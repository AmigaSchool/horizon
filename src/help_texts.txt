#ENTITY_GATE_SWAP_GROUP
Defines whether a gate can be swapped with other gates of the same unit.

Gates in swap group 0 can't be swapped at all.

Gates in a nonzero swap group can be swapped with other gates of the same swap group and unit.

#ENTITY_GATE_SUFFIX
Suffix that gets appended to the reference designator, for example U101B.

Leave blank for single-gate entities. Use A,B,C,â€¦ for multi-gate entities.

If there's a gate dedicated to power supply, its suffix should be P.

#ENTITY_GATE_NAME
If there's only a single gate, its name should be "Main".

#UNIT_PIN_ALT_NAMES
If a pin has multiple functions, add these here.

For example: Pin name: PB0, alternate names: I2C0_SDA ADC2_IN.

#POSITION_FORMAT
<tt>printf</tt>-style formatting for positions.

<tt>%.</tt>&lt;precision&gt;&lt;unit&gt;
precision: number of decimal places 0...9
unit: <tt>m</tt>: millimeter, <tt>i</tt>: inch, <tt>t</tt>: thou/mil, <tt>u</tt>: micrometer

#SYMBOL_CAN_EXPAND
Set this for box-style symbols if there are alternate pin names or the user is expected to add custom pin names. In this case, size the symbol such that it fits the primary pin names.

#PLANE_PRIORITY
Planes with lower fill order will get filled first.
Make sure to assign distinct fill orders to overlapping planes.
A plane completely enclosing another one needs a higher fill order than the enclosed plane.

#ROUTING_OFFSET
When routing or dragging a track, this offset gets added to the clearance specified in the rules.
You can override it in the router tool.

#INPUT_DEVICES
If a touchpad or trackpoint isn't detected as such, you can manually set the device type.

#INPUT_DEVICE_TYPES
Select invert zoom/pan to reverse the scrolling direction for zooming or panning.
